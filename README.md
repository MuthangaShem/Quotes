# Angular Quotes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## How it works

You type in a quote, the author and your name (The submiiter of the quote). When you submit, It will be displayed at the bottom of the page. You can vote for it (upvote) and downvote. The more the votes it gets, the higher it climbs to the top.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
